## Interactive system for creation of notes
We are overwhelmed by information from various topics. The challenge
in education is to create notes which covers important subset of information.
There are known methods to extract information from text. In this
article we propose a system to extract the notes from text which are important
for educational purpose, so it should create personalized notes for students. We
use mainly syntactic text analysis. Notes are created by help of part-of-speech
tags and dependencies between words in sentences. The outcome will be an
interactive application for creating notes based on learned rules from user.
